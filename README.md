This is still a very premature repository and I still have much work to do on the core system.

The final version will use Cairo to generate images generated by interpreting Lisp-like code.

The core system is *heavily influenced* by this article [Lisp in less than 200 lines of C](https://carld.github.io/2017/06/20/lisp-in-less-than-200-lines-of-c.html).
