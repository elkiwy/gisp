# Gisp

This is still a very premature repository and I still have much work to do on the core system.

The final version will use Cairo to generate images generated by interpreting Lisp-like code.

The core system is *heavily influenced* by this article [Lisp in less than 200 lines of C](https://carld.github.io/2017/06/20/lisp-in-less-than-200-lines-of-c.html).



# Done
- **Cons/List Operations**: *car/cdr*, *list*
- **Math**: *add/sub/mul/div*
- **Strings**: *str*
- **I/O**: *read*. *write*
- **Functions**: *lambda*


# Todo
- Function definitions
- REPL
- map and reduce functions
- advanced math functions
- advanced string functions
- and/or/not boolean operations
- Cairo wrapping
